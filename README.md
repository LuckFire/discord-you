# Idea Scrapped
The idea of this theme has been scrapped, I may revist it in the future but I wouldn't count on it if I were you. I lack the brain power to actually properly do this, and it's basically more than I can chew. It'd require a lot of help from others, which is something I probably can't really easily get. (if someone is interested in helping ayo message me).

But TL;DR: theme idea scrapped because I cannot manage this myself. Sorry if I let anyone down (but please remember I'm doing this in my free time. it's not worth stressing myself out over).

Hopefully more info soon, this idea literally just began today (12/7/2021), and there's a lot that needs to be done planning wise.
